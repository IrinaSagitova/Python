There is a program that compresses photos, and there is a folder "Source" with the photos themselves. We want to reduce each photo to 200px in width (the height varies proportionally). It is necessary to run a program for each photo and put the result of the work in the folder "Result". Note that the user does not have "Result" folders and the program will be launched several times.
